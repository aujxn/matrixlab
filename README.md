# matrixlab

matrixlab is a Rust library for working with both sparse and dense
matricies. The library is fully functional, though a little clunky.
There's likely to be API changes as this is still in heavy development.

There's a smattering of documentation in rustdoc, but there's still more
work to be done here as well. Hopefully a combination of the documentation
and source code is enough to get you started!

Currently solving matricies via GMRES, backsolving, and least squares
is possible.
